Go to Control Panel > Programs and Features > Turn Windows Features on or off. Uncheckmark SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support

Or run this command in with adminrights started powershell:
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol

Reboot.

To test if SMB1 is active, run this powershell command:
Get-WindowsOptionalFeature –Online –FeatureName SMB1Protocol
