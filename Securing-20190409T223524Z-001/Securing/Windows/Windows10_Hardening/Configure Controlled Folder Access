    Use Windows-I to open the Settings application.
    Select Update & Security > Windows Defender, and activate "Open Windows Defender Security Center".
    Select Virus & threat protection when the new application window opens.
    On the page that opens, select Virus & threat protection settings.
    Make sure that real-time protection is enabled.
    Locate Controlled Folder Access on the page, and switch its toggle to on.
    
    The list of folders that are protected by Controlled Folder Access is displayed when you click on the link. Windows Defender protects some folders automatically; these are:
    User: Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music, Desktop, Favorites
    Public: Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music, Desktop

    You cannot remove these default folders, but you can add custom folder locations so that the added folders are protected by the security feature as well.
    Click on "add a protected folder" to select a local folder and have it added to the protected folders listing.
