This registry setting config your UAC (User Account Control) to maximum level like it was in Windows Vista by default.
Since Windows 7 Microsoft set this a level lower, because of stupid users.

Go to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\
and set the string 
ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin
to
2

Finish. No restart required. You can config this in Windows settings too.
