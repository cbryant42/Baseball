The Attack Surface Reduction protection can be configured in three different ways:
    Using Group Policy.
    Using PowerShell.
    Using MDM CSP.
    
Group Policy:
    Tap on the Windows-key, type gpedit.msc and hit the Enter-key to start the Group Policy editor on Windows 10.
    Navigate to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Windows Defender Exploit Guard > Attack Surface Reduction
    Double-click on the policy "Configure Attack surface reduction rules".
    Set the policy to enabled.
    Setting the policy to enabled activates the "show" button. Click on show to load the "show contents" window.

    Show contents is a table that accepts one Attack Surface Reduction rule per row.  Value name is the ID that is listed under rules above in the brackets.

    Value accepts the following input:
    0 = disabled. The rule is not active.
    1 = enabled. The rule is active, and block mode is activated.
    2 = audit mode. Events will be recorded, but the actual rule is not enforced.
    
PowerShell:
    You may use PowerShell to configure rules.
    Tap on the Windows-key, type PowerShell, hold down the Shift-key and the Ctrl-key, and load the PowerShell entry with a click.
    Use the following command to add a blocking mode rule:
    Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids <rule ID> -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions Enabled
    
    Use the following command to add an audit mode rule:
    Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids <rule ID> -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions AuditMode

    Use the following command to set a rule to disabled:
    Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids <rule ID> -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions Disabled

    You can combine multiple rules in a single command by separating each rule with a comma, and by listing states individually for each rule. Example:
    Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids <rule ID>, <rule ID 2>, <rule ID 3> -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions Disabled, Enabled, Enabled

    Note: you can use Set-MpPreference or Add-MpPreference. The Set command will always overwrite the existing set of rules while the Add command adds to it without overwriting existing rules.
    You can display the set of rules using the Get-MpPreference command.
    
    
You can exclude files or folders so that the excluded items are not evaluated by Attack Surface Reduction rules.

Group Policy: Go to Computer configuration > Administrative templates > Windows components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Windows Defender Exploit Guard > Attack surface reduction > Exclude files and paths from Attack surface reduction Rules. Set the policy to enabled, click on the show button, and add files or folders (folder path or resource, e.g. c:\Windows in the value name, and 0 in the value field of each column.
PowerShell: Use the command Add-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionOnlyExclusions "<fully qualified path or resource>" to add files or folders to the exclusions list.
