This registry setting disable Autorun & Autoplay.
In the past that was abused by Malware.

You then need to manual open new devices like connected USB drive. No popups opens automatically.


Go to
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer
(create if not exist) a DWORD key named
NoDriveTypeAutoRun
and one named
NoAutorun
Then paste this value for NoDriveTypeAutoRun:
000000b5
And this for NoAutorun:
00000001

Finish. No restart required. You can config this in Windows settings too.
