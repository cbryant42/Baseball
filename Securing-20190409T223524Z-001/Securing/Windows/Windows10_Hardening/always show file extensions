On standard Windows settings, Malware can hide itself if the filename is like:
Secure-File.txt.exe

What you see? A file named
Secure-File.txt

Of course the attacker can add a differend icon to the file, so it looks like you open the file extension you think.
And if you then open the file, its to late. See Crypto trojans

Go to
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced
and change the string
HideFileExt
to
00000000

Finish. No restart required. You can config this in Windows explorersettings too.
